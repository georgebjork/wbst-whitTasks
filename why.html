            <p class="text-muted h-6 lead">
                WhitTasks is an app that George Bjork and Madeline Schiefelbein are developing that provides students with the ease of creating a schedule that fits their needs. The current issue is that there is no way for students to be able to plan out each day to their own personal schedule. The current system in place that is optional for students to have would be the Blackboard app, and that provides its own challenges, such as the lag when assignments are posted. The Blackboard app is limited to only assignment postings as well. Our app provides students with the ability to add in their own school schedule, as well as activities around campus that they are interested in attending, or meetings that they have to attend. Another feature would include the ability to add in assignments and group projects that the student has. Students can add these into a checklist feature of the app that would allow them to check off each of these “tasks” as they are completed. To add to this feature, professors would also be able to access the assignments portion of the app and add in tasks for the student to complete. Professors would also be able to send out notifications to students, such as the cancelation of class.
